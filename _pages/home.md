I am a PhD student at the [Computer Graphics Laboratory at ETH Zurich](https://cgl.ethz.ch/) in cooperation with [DisneyResearch\|Studios](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/) since May 2021.
I am supervised by [Prof. Markus Gross](https://cgl.ethz.ch/people/grossm/) and [Dr. Romann M. Weber](https://randomwalk.blog/about-me/).
My research interests include various areas of deep learning and especially generative modeling. 
I always find it most fascinating and satisfying if I'm working on projects that interact with the environment in some way, i.e., where I can see/hear/feel its results.
In recent years, I focused mostly on face-related image and video generation tasks.

Before the PhD, I completed my master's degree in *Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence* at the Technical University of Munich. Thereby, I became really interested in deep learning and had the privilege to work on my master's thesis and several other projects in [Prof. Laura Leal-Taix√©'s Dynamic Vision and Learning Group](https://dvl.in.tum.de/).
Before that, I did my bachelor's degree at the Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW) Stuttgart in cooperation with Robert Bosch GmbH.
