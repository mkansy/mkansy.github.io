I am a final year master's student at the University of Konstanz. 
My general areas of interest are machine learning and computer vision. 
More specifically, I am highly interested in Geometric Deep Learning and Neural Scene Representations.  
Currently I am working on my master's thesis under the supervision of Prof. Bastian Goldl√ºcke, 
where I am exploring how a geometrically inspired neural network design 
can benefit neural implicit shape representations for 3D reconstruction.   
In my future research I hope to take steps towards algorithms, that like humans, 
easily perceive, understand and abstractly reason about their 3D environments from few observations.
