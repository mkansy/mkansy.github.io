# My Simple Personal Website
# Adapted from "Allan Lab" Website Template


This website is powered by Jekyll and some Bootstrap, Bootwatch. We tried to make it simple yet adaptable, so that it is easy for you to use it as a template. Plese feel free to copy and modify for your own purposes.  You don't have to link to us or mention us (but of course we appreciate it).

Go to [this website](https://www.allanlab.org/aboutwebsite.html) for more information.
