  conference: IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) Workshops, 2023
  description: We tackle the challenging task of inverting the latent space of pre-trained face recognition models without full model access (i.e. black-box setting). Our method, the identity denoising diffusion probabilistic model (ID3PM), leverages the stochastic nature of the denoising diffusion process to produce high-quality, identity-preserving face images with various backgrounds, lighting, poses, and expressions.

  description: The terms high-resolution and high-quality are not equivalent, and high-resolution does not always imply high-quality. In this paper, we motivate and precisely define the concept of effective resolution and propose a novel self-supervised learning scheme to train a neural network for effective resolution estimation. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art image quality assessment methods in estimating the sharpness of real and generated human faces, despite using only unlabeled data during training.
